## Description ##

`zs-tui` is a TUI version for processing files, whose scope is yet to be
defined.  So far it lists functions along with their size and parameter count
and allows viewing those functions in source code as well as viewing dump of
their internal representation.

It's not clear if it's worth adding diffing functionality here.  It's probably
not, which means that this tool will be mostly for interactive browsing or
similar activities and other tools might be created out of it.
